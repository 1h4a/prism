# prism 

Prism is a library of program shaders aimed to encourage Java mapmakers to "set the scene" better by utilizing all of vanilla Minecraft's potential, including vanilla shaders, as well as containing utilities (in the form of includes and ultra-light software to make certain tasks easier) and several fragment and vertex shaders that are left for developers to use in their own shaders.

Eventually, Prism will also contain guides and a comprehensive wiki for Prism-specific shaders and vanilla shaders and their development.

**Current Stable Release: None! It'll be done soon <3**

You can use Prism and its components, disassemble them, heavily alter them, etc. freely in your own projects, as long as you disclose the original source.

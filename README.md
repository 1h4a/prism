Prism is designed to be companion software to Minecraft Java mapmakers and aims to expand their options in terms of graphics.

Currently planned features:
- Re-write of what used to be [pthy](https://github.com/1h4a/pthy-source)
- Resource management and world bundling
- Vanilla shader library, simplified (non-text based) shader editing and default render options
